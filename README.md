## üóÇÔ∏è 1. Overview

This serves as a repository for the Voi ecosystem proposals and a staging point (via GitHub issues) for discussion around said proposals.

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

## üìö 2. Documentation

The VIP documentation is hosted [here][documentation].

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

## ü™Ñ 3. Usage

### 3.1. Fork The Repo

Before creating and submitting a VIP, you will need to [fork](https://github.com/voi-community/voi-improvement-proposals/fork) this repo.

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

### 3.2. Create A New VIP

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** It is **RECOMMENDED** you read [VIP-00-0000][vip-00-0000] in order to understand the guidelines around VIPs.

When you have decided on the category and the indexing of your proposed VIP, copy the [vip-template.md](./vip-template.md) into the `vips/<category>/<index>/` directory (where category is the category index and index is the VIP index).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** Your VIP index directory **MUST** use padded zeroes if your index is below 1000, e.g. if your index is 27, the directory to create will be `0027/`.

<sup>[Back to top ^][table-of-contents]</sup>

### 3.3. Open A PR

Once you are ready for the VIP to be reviewed and open for discussion, open a PR from the forked repo against the `main` branch and ensure the PR title is in the format:

````text
VIP-##-####: Title
````

The first digits (after `VIP-`), will be the number of category, followed by the index of your VIP, and then the capitalized title.

For example: `VIP-03-0200: Fungible Tokens`.

## üõ† 4. Development

### 4.1. Overview

While the VIPs are essentially a collection of markdown files, the static site that host the VIPs is built using [Hugo][hugo] (which is built in Go).

While it is not necessary to run an instance of Hugo to write an VIP, you can see how the VIP will render.
